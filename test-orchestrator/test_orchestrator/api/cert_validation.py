"""
Provides FastAPI endpoints for validating business partner certificates and related components.

This module defines a set of API endpoints built with FastAPI to test and validate
the implementation of the Business Partner Certificate and the Company Certificate
Management API (CCMAPI) within the Catena-X network. It allows for the validation
of certificate payloads against their semantic models, tests the setup of CCMAPI
offers, verifies the feedback mechanism, and validates the structure of feedback
messages.

The primary goal is to ensure that a participant's implementation conforms to the
defined standards (e.g., CX-0135), facilitating interoperability across the network.

Endpoints:
- GET /feedbackmechanism-validation/: Tests if the feedback mechanism of a test subject works.
- POST /cert-validation-test/: Validates a given certificate against its semantic model and tests feedback delivery.
- GET /ccmapi-offer-test/: Validates the correctness of a CCMAPI asset offer and its associated usage policy.
- POST /feedbackmessage-validation/: Validates a given feedback message against its semantic model.
